# Data Augmentation with Multi-armed Bandit on Image Deformations Improves Fluorescence Glioma Boundary Recognition

---

This is the official implementation of **MICCAI 2024** paper "***Data Augmentation with Multi-armed Bandit on Image Deformations Improves Fluorescence Glioma Boundary Recognition***". 

The proposed data augmentation method "Explore and Exploit Augment" (EEA) can improve the representation ability of small-scale data to improve the classification performance of different types of DL models.
